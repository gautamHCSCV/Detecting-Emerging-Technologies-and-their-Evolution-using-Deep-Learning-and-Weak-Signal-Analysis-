# Detecting-Emerging-Technologies-and-their-Evolution-using-Deep-Learning-and-Weak-Signal-Analysis-
We present a multi-layer quantitative approach able to identify future signs from scientific publications on hypersonics by leveraging deep learning and weak signal analysis. The proposed framework can help strategic planners and domain experts better identify and monitor emerging technology trends.
