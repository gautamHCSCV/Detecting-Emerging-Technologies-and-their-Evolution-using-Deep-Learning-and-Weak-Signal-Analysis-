# Detecting-Emerging-Technologies-and-their-Evolution-using-Deep-Learning-and-Weak-Signal-Analysis-
We present a multi-layer quantitative approach able to identify future signs from scientific publications on hypersonics by leveraging deep learning and weak signal analysis. The proposed framework can help strategic planners and domain experts better identify and monitor emerging technology trends.

This is a direct implementation of the following paper: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.05449.pdf

In the paper, authors have presented a multi-layer quantitative approach able to identify
future signs from scientific publications on different technical terms by leveraging deep
learning and weak signal analysis. First, they improve upon keyword extraction by going
beyond traditional statistical approaches and leverage a pre-trained transformer-based
deep learning technique, namely BERT. Second, they apply recent concepts of weak signal
analysis to the early detection of technology emergence. Weak signal is defined as a signal
that can affect the business or its environment, could be difficult to track, and needs time to
become mature and mainstream. Weak signals can be regarded as signals about future
trends of a given technology.
